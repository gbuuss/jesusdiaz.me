			<p>I'm Rakesh Dubai based UI/UX/Web Designer and Front-End Developer.</p>
			<p>I am able to work effectively in a team or on my Own. I have demonstrated an ability to lead small Teams and mentor other workers. I pride myself on being able to use my knowledge and initiative to deliver high quality results to tight deadlines. I enjoy a challenge and look for the opportunity to expand and develop my skill set.</p>
			<p>Some people call what I do User Experience Design, some call it Web design, some think I am a Front-End Developer, others see me as a UI Designer. I see what I do as a combination of all these things and ultimately donâ€™t think it really matters which label you like to use.</p>
			<p>What does matter is the output of my work, which is always focused at the point where user, business and technical requirements meet and tends to become a perfect product.</p>
